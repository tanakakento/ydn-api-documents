# SOAP Error Codes
### Error Process Outline
When a SOAP request is successful, YDN API sends back the "HTTP 200 OK" response code, along with a SOAP response. <br>If an error occurs while a SOAP request is being processed, YDN API sends back a message with an error code. <br>
For details, please refer to [Error](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Error.md) and/or [ErrorDetail](/docs/en/api_reference/data/ErrorDetail.md).<br>

### Sample Error Response

There are 3 types of SOAP error response, SAPFault, Full error and Part error. See the following description about each response.

#### SOAPFault

SOAPFault response returns for WSDL violation, SOAP syntax violation, system error and authentication error.<br>
`<faultcode>` describes an error code, and `<faultstring>` describes an error message.<br>
Detail error are described in `<detail>` in some cases.

The following response is an example of SOAPFault in the case of login failure on [AccountService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/AccountService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <SOAP-ENV:Fault>
      <faultcode>110006</faultcode>
      <faultstring>Can not login for apiAccountId.</faultstring>
      <faultactor/>
      <detail>
        <requestKey>apiAccountId</requestKey>
        <requestValue>xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx</requestValue>
      </detail>
    </SOAP-ENV:Fault>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

SOAPFault response form depends on API versions. The form above is in case of V201806 version.

#### Full Error

Full Error is returned for the fail of entire request caused by request constraints, etc. It is different from SOAPFault.<br>
Part Error is returned for the request fail caused by constraints in each ‘<operand>’ of SOAP request.

The following response is an example of Full Error in the case of invalid ‘numberResults’ value of `Paging` in [AccountService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/AccountService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201806" xmlns:ns2="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201806/Account" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <SOAP-ENV:Header>
    <ns2:ResponseHeader>
      <ns1:service>AccountService</ns1:service>
      <ns1:timeTakenSeconds>0.1234</ns1:timeTakenSeconds>
      <ns1:requestTime>1234567890</ns1:requestTime>
    </ns2:ResponseHeader>
  </SOAP-ENV:Header>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <ns2:getResponse>
      <ns2:error>
        <ns1:code>120003</ns1:code>
        <ns1:message>Invalid number format.</ns1:message>
        <ns1:detail>
          <ns1:requestKey>numberResults</ns1:requestKey>
          <ns1:requestValue>1000000</ns1:requestValue>
        </ns1:detail>
      </ns2:error>
    </ns2:getResponse>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

#### Part Error

Part Error is returned in the error case caused by constraints of each element in ‘<operand>’.<br>
Part Error is returned for each ‘<operand>’, whether an error occurred or not.<br>
The error response may contain both of ‘true’ and ‘false’ as value of ‘<operationSucceeded>’, since '<value>' returns for each '<operand>' when you send a single SOAP request which includes multiple ‘<operand>’.

The following response is an example of Part Error in the case of specifying a ‘reportId’ which does not exist in [ReportService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/ReportService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201806" xmlns:ns2="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201806/Report" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

    </ns2:ResponseHeader>
  </SOAP-ENV:Header>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>

        <ns1:ListReturnValue.Type>ReportReturnValue</ns1:ListReturnValue.Type>
        <ns1:Operation.Type>ADD</ns1:Operation.Type>
        <ns2:values>
          <ns1:operationSucceeded>false</ns1:operationSucceeded>
          <ns1:error>
            <ns1:code>120022</ns1:code>
            <ns1:message>Deactivated.</ns1:message>
            <ns1:detail>
              <ns1:requestKey>reportId</ns1:requestKey>
              <ns1:requestValue>1234567890</ns1:requestValue>
            </ns1:detail>
          </ns1:error>
        </ns2:values>
      </ns2:rval>
    </ns2:mutateResponse>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```
